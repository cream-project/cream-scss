# Cream
Frontend goodies at your disposal. Modular, extendable and keeps things simple.

# cream-scss
Collection of [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) files. You can use them in any way you like, but they are made with the [Cream](https://github.com/cream-project) environment in mind.

Uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to generate vendor prefixes, so just forget about them ;)

The documentation format can be used with [Hologram](http://trulia.github.io/hologram/), to automatically generate a styleguide.

Check [STYLE.md](https://github.com/cream-project/cream-scss/blob/master/STYLE.md) for coding conventions.
